<h1> Geoffery Kagotho</h1>
<P>My name is Geoffrey kagotho or as many people know me, Jeff. I i'm 19 years old and joined Kca university at the begining of this year 2023, to pursue a course in
business information technology. I was aware of this course while still in highschool for i always had a burning passion in knowing more about the ever growing 
technology and acquire skills to start and run a business. If you asked me years ago if i wanted to become a computer expert, my answer would have been NO. 
I always dreamt of becoming a lawyer, fight for the innocent and punish the guilty. If only it was that easy.</p>
<p>Technology is one of the thing you cannot fail to mension while talking about development. Basically, everything that is developing must have a drict link to 
technology. This is the reason i love technology, it is everywhere and applied in everything. It would be a hundred percent right if i say that, if you want to add more
value to yourselft, grow together with the technology.</p>
<p>Right now i'm halfway in my two-year term in kca, time really goes by really fast! i will be graduating in the comming year in my diploma studies. I will further enhace
 my studies in courses that go much deeper into tech. Where my thoughts stand on right now is to pursue a Bachelor in Information Security and Forensics. But who knows?
better things do come. LOVELY </p>
