<p>Some of the examples of Information technology include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal computers</li>
<li>Video conferencing equipment</li>

</ul>
<p>Studting IT comes with a bunch of privillages. One of them is that you have a wide variety of job areas you can choose. Below are a few examples of jobs 
you can get as an It person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Computer Programmer</li>
<li>Web Developer</li>
<li>Software Engineer</li>
<li>Data Scientist</li>
<li>IT Technician</li>
</ol>
<p>We can more further describe IT jobs under two basis;</p>
