<p1>
My name is Emmanuel Ayela, i was born in Kenya but am a South sudanese nationl. I love kenya
.cause it was literally where i was born in
My country has been in prolonged conflict among two tribes,one of the favorites things i love
about kenyans is that they are very good at supporting each other,by being honest being selected 
as an information student at kcau was my great pleasure.
<p>
The education system in kenya is the best one in kenya whereby children are taught to be the future
leaders of the society.The food is also good especially the street foods like the mtura and mahindi
choma plus the nyama choma.
</p>
<p>
The fashion trend is also something else to talk about the dashikis and the modern fashion trends,matatus
are also something not to forget brcause they are vibrant and attractive.
</p>
<p>
South Sudan is a beautiful country it's just the fact that there has been civil war making the country unstable
whereby making people think that the country is always in war.We have one of the tallest
tribes in the world the Dinkas and our darkskin complexion makes us to be the best models out there like the likes of 
Adut
